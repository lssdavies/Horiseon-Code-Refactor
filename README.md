# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

This repository contains a code refactoring for Horiseon. The purpose of this refactor is to modify the existing codebase so that the code meets accessibility standards and the site is optimized for search engines. In addition to modifying the HTML I have also made the CSS more efficient, by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Changes made to HTML

1. Title was updated to Horiseon from SEO
2. Replaced <div> tags with the appropriate semantic tags  where necessary i.e. <header>, <footer>, <nav>, etc.
3. Fixed broken Search Engine Optimization link adding the id attrtibute to the related page section.
4. Added alt attribute to all images and icons.
5. Updated CSS so styling applies to semantic tags that were added to index.html.
6. Consolidated CSS to remove repetition
7. Added comments to CSS.
